# INTRODUCTION-TO-PROBLEM-SOLVING-AND-PROGRAMMING-PROJECT
PROJECT TITLE: BASIC IMAGE SLIDESHOW PLAYER WITH AUTOMATED TRANSITIONS
OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT: This is a Python-based Image Slideshow Application that automatically displays a collection of images in sequence with timed transitions. Built using Tkinter for the graphical interface and PIL (Pillow) for image processing, this project provides a simple yet effective solution for automated image presentation.
FEATURES OF THIS PROJECT: It is a fully automated image slideshow program that has fixed time interval between each transitions i.e 3 seconds. This code supports the slideshow for common image formats(i.e PNG, JPG AND WEBP).
TECHNOLOGIES AND TOOLS USED IN MAKING OF THIS PROJECT: This entire code is writen in python 3.x programming language. I have imported the standard python library i.e the tkinter and for image processing we have imported the PIL/ pillow library and we have used the itertools.cycle for the cycle management of the image slideshow program.

HOW TO RUN THE CODE: once you run this code in the terminal you will directed towards another python generated window where the slideshow of images will be played, you just need to click on the "play slideshow" button present on the top of the slideshow window and then your image slideshow will start to play
